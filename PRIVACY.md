- No telemetry data is gathered about component performance or usage patterns

### Third-Party Dependencies

While ShadUI itself does not collect data, it uses third-party dependencies (such as Avalonia). Users should review the privacy policies of these dependencies separately.

## Data Storage

- ShadUI does not store any user data
- Any data displayed through ShadUI components is managed entirely by your application
- No cache or local storage is maintained by the library

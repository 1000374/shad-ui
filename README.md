ShadUI is an **Avalonia-based Desktop UI Library** inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

To get started with ShadUI:

Install the [ShadUI NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ShadUI/):

```powershell
dotnet add package ShadUI --version [version]
```

Include ShadTheme in your App.xaml:

```xml
<Application
    xmlns:themes="clr-namespace:ShadUI.Themes;assembly=ShadUI">

    <!-- other code -->

    <Application.Styles>
        <themes:ShadTheme />
        <!-- other styles -->
    </Application.Styles>
